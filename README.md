# Res---A-new-way-of-metting-people.-MockUps-
Res was an IOS application idea that allowed individuals to step out of their comfort zone and attend events near their locations. A full report of the application along with the mock-ups can be found in this repository. The report begins with identifying a target demographic and coming up with a problem statement. After those were determined, my team’s next goal was to create personas that matched our target demographic. Upon completing those, we than created problem scenarios for each persona and how their problems can be solved by our application- (Context scenarios). Later on, in the report we discus about lightning demos where my team and I observed other successful applications and applied some of the features we liked from them to our own app. In order to get a picture of our mock-up my group worked on card sorting and vision statements. Finally, with the help of Axure – a mockup tool, my team and I were able to create an interactive Mock-up of our application. The full step by step of the Mock-up can be found in the report or in the code files.
